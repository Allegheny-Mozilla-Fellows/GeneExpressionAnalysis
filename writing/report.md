## Questions in Blue (Analysis)
*Note: In order for GatorGrader to correctly count the words you use in your responses, please drop a line between the question and your response. This line should help you to pass the word count check.*


  0. What does gsub() do in this code block?

  `TODO`

  1. What does the plot on the next line show?

  `TODO`

  2. Plot 2 is a scaled view of the same information from Plot 1. Why is scaling helpful when viewing these results of "Plot 2 ?

  `TODO`

  3. What is the function "mutate()" doing in this code block?

  `TODO`

  4. What is the function "summarise()" doing in this code block?

  `TODO`

  5. Interpret the results of Plot 3.

  `TODO`

  6. Interpret the results of Plot 4.

  `TODO`

  7. In Plot 5, both of the previous plots have been combined together on the same canvas. How does this, either help or confuse the output of these lines of code?

  `TODO`

  8. What do the whiskers (i.e., the big "I" shaped structures above each histogram bar) convey in this plot? Why might we need to know this information?

  `TODO`

  9. The word, "function" is below in the code block. What does this part of the code do?

  `TODO`

  10. Some time is necessary to generate the variable, "ProbeR2". What is taking this code block so long to complete? What is the "lm()" function in R?

  `TODO`

  11. With the above ideas about R-squared values in mind, which Probe in Plot 8 appears to be able to best explain the model?

  `TODO`

  12. In Plot 9 we see two curves. What can you infer about the relationships between the Actual cases of relationships and those cases for which no relationship exists? Remember, the blue curve corresponds to the variable "r2" and the red curve corresponds to the Null values.

  `TODO`

  13. Plot 10, is very important to determine a result concerning the Actual data sets and the Null data sets. How do we use this plot to conclude that the 30 probes in Plot 8 are relevant results (i.e., these cases demonstrate relationships)?

  `TODO`

## Questions in Blue (Ethics)

 1. Discuss what is meant by the term _autonomy_.

  `TODO`

 2. What can go wrong in technology to create a such a leak that they mention.

  `TODO`

 3. The authors mention that paper records could only be viewed by one person at a time. In this case, each medical record would have to be check-out at the medical records room in a hospital. In your opinion, do you think that this would be a better form of security for the records, even though the process of getting to the records would be extremely slow for the doctors who require this information?

  `TODO`

 4. The authors also mention that, _Clinical personnel often have little knowledge of the clinic's workflow and the roles others play in care delivery._ How could this lack of coordination be an ethical problem?

  `TODO`
